# chip8-emulator

This C++ project was started as a way of learning low-level C++ programming and building something for fun. 

NOTE: This is WIP and code is continuously updated to add additional functionality.

The starting point is building a CHIP-8 disassembler to get the basic functionality and interpreter implemented. This will later on be implemented as part of a renderer to form the full CHIP-8 emulator.
